# Audio-Restoration using median filter and cubic_splines
 #Introduction
Audio restoration is a critical aspect of signal processing, 
addressing challenges such as noise reduction and reconstruction of distorted samples. The assigned Task 2 is about dealing with clicks using 
median filtering and cubic spline interpolation, in the context of audio signal enhancement. Through their distinct approaches, 
these methods aim to refine audio quality by mitigating noise and interpolating missing or distorted components.
